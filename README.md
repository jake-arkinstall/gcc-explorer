# gcc-explorer

A browser based tool to make [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) build logs easier to read, with emphasize on
highlighting various build warnings. GCC has a tendency to spit out a lot of
warnings while building, and as the build output is very verbose, developers
tend to ignore/miss the warnings as they don't fail the build and to not stick
out. With this visual tool exploring the warnings is a lot easier.
